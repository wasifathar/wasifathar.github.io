# Portfolio Starter (No-Build, Free Hosting)

This is a **free, no‑build portfolio** you can deploy on **GitHub Pages** in minutes.

## Quick Start

1. Edit `index.html` — replace `Your Name`, links, and content.
2. (Optional) Put your resume at `assets/resume.pdf` and update the link in the hero section.
3. Commit everything to a repo named `yourusername.github.io` on GitHub.
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` — it's live!

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

- Create a new public repo called **`yourusername.github.io`** (must match your GitHub username).
- Upload the files in this folder (or push via git).
- In **Settings → Pages**, ensure Source is set to **`Deploy from a branch`**, branch **`main`**, folder **`/ (root)`**.
- GitHub will publish your site at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize

- Colors & spacing: edit CSS variables at the top of `styles.css`.
- Dark/Light mode: auto by system, with a manual toggle (saved in `localStorage`).
- Social preview: edit `assets/og-image.png` and the `<meta>` tags in `<head>`.
- Contact: the form currently uses `mailto:` to open the user's email app. You can later swap to a free form backend (e.g., Formspree) without changing hosting.

## Notes

- This site is **static** (no server needed), so it stays free on GitHub Pages.
- No external libraries = fast loads and fewer things to maintain.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, labeled controls, visible focus, sufficient contrast.
